If you need a more robust starter or a starter with testing \"out of the box\" then please use one of those great starters.**\r\n\r\n**Note 2: I am still new to Angular and have left out testing to keep this starter as simple as possible.  I plan to add it in at some point in the future.**\r\n\r\nAn easy to use and understand starter template for [Angular 2](http://angular.io) with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).\r\n\r\nThis seed repo serves as an Angular 2 starter for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript fast. Using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for building our files and assisting with boilerplate. \r\n\r\n* Ready to go build system using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) for working with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).\r\n* Separate application config object per environment.\r\n* Stylesheets with SCSS (not required, it supports regular css too.  Less and Sass are good to as long as you wire up the install and wire up a loader).\r\n* Error reported with [TSLint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer).\r\n* Documentation with [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/).\r\n\r\n>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM\r\n\r\n### Quick start\r\n\r\n> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.component.ts`](/src/app/app.component.ts)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# clone our repo\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/wwestbrook/ng2-webpack.git my-app\r\n\r\n# change directory to your app\r\n$ cd my-app\r\n\r\n# install the dependencies with npm\r\n$ npm install\r\n\r\n# start the server\r\n$ npm start\r\n```\r\ngo to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.\r\n\r\n# Table of Contents\r\n\r\n* [Getting Started](#getting-started)\r\n    * [Dependencies](#dependencies)\r\n    * [Installing](#installing)\r\n    * [Developing](#developing)\r\n    * [Production](#production)\r\n    * [Documentation](#documentation)\r\n* [TypeScript](#typescript)\r\n* [License](#license)\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nWhat you need to run this app:\r\n* `node` and `npm` \r\n* Ensure you're running Node (`v6.x.x`+) and NPM (`3.x.x`+)\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\n* `fork` this repo\r\n* `clone` your fork\r\n* `npm install` to install all dependencies\r\n\r\n## Developing\r\n\r\nAfter you have installed all dependencies you can now start developing with:\r\n\r\n* `npm start:dev` \r\n\r\nIt will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The application can be checked at `http://localhost:8080`.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, you can work using Webpack Dashboard:\r\n\r\n* `npm run serve:dev`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Production\r\n\r\nTo build your application, run:\r\n\r\n* `npm run build`\r\n\r\nYou can now go to `/dist` and deploy that to your server!\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can generate api docs (using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)) for your code with the following:\r\n\r\n* `npm run docs`\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Do I need to add script / link tags into index.html ?\r\n\r\nNo, Webpack will add all the needed Javascript bundles as script tags and all the CSS files as link tags. The advantage is that you don't need to modify the index.html every time you build your solution to update the hashes.\r\n\r\n#### How to include external angular 2 libraries ?\r\n\r\nIt's simple, just install the lib via npm and import it in your code when you need it. Don't forget that you need to configure some external libs in the [bootstrap](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/main.ts) of your application.\r\n\r\n#### How to include external css files such as bootstrap.css ?\r\n\r\nJust install the lib and import the css files in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts). For example this is how to do it with bootstrap:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install bootstrap@next --save\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts) add the following:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';\r\n```",
